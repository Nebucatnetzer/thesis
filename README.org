This repository contains the documentation and code for my "thesis" at
the IBZ school.

The original location of this repository is:
https://git.2li.ch/Nebucatnetzer/thesis

To build the documents you need the following applications installed on your
system:
- inkscape
- texlive-full
- emacs
- graphviz

If your system fullfills this depencies then you can navigate in either the
folder "projekantrag" or the folder "projekthandbuch" and execute the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
#+END_SRC

This should build the document for you and create a PDF document in the
directory you executed the command.
